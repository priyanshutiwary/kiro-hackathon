   - How much time did you spend?
   - What technical decisions did you make?
   - Any challenges or interesting solutions?
   - How did Kiro help?

2. **Quick documentation check**:
   - Do steering files need updates based on today's work?
   - Are there new features to document in product.md?
   - Did architecture change (update tech.md)?
   - Did structure change (update structure.md)?

3. **Summary**:
   - Provide a brief summary of what was accomplished
   - Note any documentation that needs attention tomorrow

Keep it concise and focused on today's work only.
