# Documentation Health Check

Review the project and check if documentation needs updates:

1. **Compare steering docs with codebase**:
   - Does `tech.md` reflect current tech stack and architecture?
   - Does `structure.md` match actual project structure?
   - Does `product.md` describe current features accurately?

2. **Check DEVLOG.md**:
   - Is recent work documented?
   - Are there gaps in the timeline?

3. **Provide recommendations**:
   - List what needs updating
   - Suggest priority (high/medium/low)
   - Offer to update specific sections

Don't make changes automatically - just report what needs attention.
